# Zenith
Zenith is a top-down perspective space shooter set in the 31st century. The player pilots a ship through space while being attacked by a variety of alien vessels. The objective of the game is to survive the multiple levels while taking down as many enemies as possible to make it to the final boss. Inspired by classic shoot-em-up games.

This project is in development to fulfill project requirements for Cps 209.

# Instructions
Begin the game by starting a new game, and choosing a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard). Once the game is started you use the left, right, up, down arrows to move around, and space to shoot. To save the current state of the game, press 's'; to load the saved state of a game, press 'l'. Make it through waves of enemies to victory. (Right now you must begin the game by pressing one of the arrow keys)
