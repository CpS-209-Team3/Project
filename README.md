# Zenith
Zenith is a top-down perspective space shooter set in the 31st century. The player pilots a ship through space while being attacked by a variety of alien vessels. The objective of the game is to survive the multiple levels while taking down as many enemies as possible to make it to the final boss. Inspired by classic shoot-em-up games.

This project is in development to fulfil project requirements for Cps 209.
